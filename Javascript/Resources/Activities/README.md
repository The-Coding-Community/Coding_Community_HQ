<h3>Here we will put some engaging activites with varying levels of difficulty for you to practice what you are learning</h3>
  <h4>1. Practice linking a JavaScript document to your HTML one and logging "Hello World" to the console</h4>
  <h4>2. Use math operators to solve the following equations and print the answers to the console (Note: do not just do the math by hand and type in the number, code a program that will do it for you)</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>Add 16 + 24 + 12</li>
   <li>Multiply 15 times 35</li>
   <li>Find the remainder of 316 divided by 6</li>
   <li>Set the variable "x" to 35 and then subtract x-18</li>
   <li>Find the answer to 5 raised to the 5th power</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>3. Log a birthday message to console when given a name and an age. For example, "Happy 31st birthday John, let's celebrate." Make sure to have variables for both the name and age of the person, don't just write out the message in it's entirety.</h4>  
  <h4>4. Modify #3 to include two different messages depending on if the person is over or under 18. Do this by using conditional statements with age set as the condition.
